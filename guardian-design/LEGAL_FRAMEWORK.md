# Guardian Legal Framework: Disclaimers & Liability Protection

**Protecting the app while empowering users**

---

## Core Legal Principle

**Guardian is a TOOL, not a PRACTITIONER**

- ✅ We provide templates based on public domain methods
- ✅ User records in their own voice (their choice, their responsibility)
- ✅ We disclaim medical/therapeutic claims
- ✅ We provide crisis resources for those who need professional help

**Liability Shield**: User-generated content + clear disclaimers = minimal exposure

---

## Public Domain Methods (No Trademark Issues)

**What We're Using**:

1. **Silva Method Countdown (5-4-3-2-1)**
   - Technique developed in 1960s
   - No active trademark on the countdown itself
   - We can say: "Based on Silva Method techniques"

2. **Gateway Breathing (5-5-5)**
   - Monroe Institute technique
   - Breathing patterns are not copyrightable
   - We can say: "Inspired by Gateway Experience breathing"

3. **Lozanov Superlearning (4-4-4-4 + Baroque)**
   - Suggestopedia principles from 1960s-70s
   - Public domain methodology
   - We can say: "Using Lozanov-style rhythmic suggestion"

4. **Polyvagal Exercises**
   - Based on Stephen Porges' theory (published science)
   - Techniques like humming, orienting are not owned
   - We can say: "Polyvagal-informed nervous system regulation"

**Bottom Line**:
- ✅ Techniques = public domain (we can use freely)
- ✅ Names = attribute sources ("based on", "inspired by")
- ❌ Don't claim we invented these methods
- ❌ Don't claim medical efficacy without FDA approval

## Why This Protects Us

### ✅ Safe Because:

1. **Clear disclaimers** (3 touchpoints)
   - Onboarding: "This is not therapy, use at own risk"
   - Before recording: "You control the content"
   - Settings: Always visible legal info

2. **User-generated content**
   - They record their own voice
   - They choose to practice
   - We just provide the structure

3. **Educational fair use**
   - We're teaching public domain methods
   - We attribute sources properly
   - We make no medical claims

4. **Crisis resources**
   - We point people to professional help
   - We don't claim to treat conditions
   - We're a wellness tool, not intervention

5. **Age gate** (18+)
   - Minors can't use voice recording
   - Reduces liability for vulnerable users

### ❌ What We DON'T Say:

- ❌ "Treats depression, anxiety, PTSD" (medical claim)
- ❌ "Certified hypnotherapy" (we're not practitioners)
- ❌ "Approved by FDA" (wellness apps aren't regulated)
- ❌ "Guaranteed results" (no outcome promises)
- ❌ "Replaces therapy" (explicitly disclaim)

---

## Comparison: How Other Apps Handle This

### Headspace
> "Headspace is not a medical device and is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease."

### Calm
> "Calm is not therapy. If you are in crisis, please contact a mental health professional."

### Insight Timer
> "This app provides meditation guidance. It is not a substitute for professional mental health care."

**Guardian follows the same model** = wellness tool + disclaimers

---

## Insurance (Optional but Recommended)

### General Liability Insurance
- Covers claims of harm from app use
- ~$500-1000/year for small app
- Providers: Hiscox, The Hartford, Next Insurance

### Cyber Liability Insurance
- Covers data breaches (if we store recordings)
- ~$500/year for small scale
- Important if we add cloud backup

**Recommendation**: Get general liability once you launch (cheap peace of mind)

---

## Template Language in App

**Instead of saying:**
> ❌ "This will cure your anxiety"
> ❌ "Clinically proven to treat PMS"

**We say:**
> ✅ "May help with relaxation and stress reduction"
> ✅ "Based on established self-hypnosis techniques"
> ✅ "Some users report feeling calmer"
> ✅ "Not intended to diagnose or treat medical conditions"

**Template footer text**:
> "This template is based on [Silva Method / Gateway Experience / Lozanov Superlearning] techniques. It is for self-improvement purposes only and is not medical advice. By recording this in your voice, you acknowledge you are practicing at your own risk."

---

## Bottom Line: You're Right

**Your instinct is correct**:

1. ✅ Techniques are public domain (not trademarked)
2. ✅ "Based on best practices" is accurate and safe
3. ✅ "At your own risk" disclaimer = standard for wellness apps
4. ✅ User's own voice = their responsibility, not ours
5. ✅ We're a tool, not a therapist = minimal liability

**As long as we**:
- Don't claim to treat medical conditions
- Provide clear disclaimers
- Offer crisis resources
- Attribute original methods
- Let user control their content

**= We're legally protected** 🛡️
