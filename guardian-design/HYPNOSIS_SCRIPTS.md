```xml

  <prosody rate="0.85" pitch="-2st">
    Close your eyes.
    <break time="2s"/>

    Take a deep breath in through your nose.
    <break time="2s"/>

    We're entering your alpha state now. Let's count down together.
    <break time="2s"/>

    Five... Feel your body beginning to relax. Your shoulders drop.
    <break time="3s"/>

    Four... Your breath slows to its natural rhythm. Nothing to force.
    <break time="3s"/>

    Three... Thoughts begin to quiet, like snow settling on the ground.
    <break time="3s"/>

    Two... You are entering your inner sanctuary. This is your safe space.
    <break time="3s"/>

    One... You are now in alpha. Your subconscious mind is receptive and open.
    <break time="3s"/>

    If you're in your luteal phase right now, your body feels different.
    <break time="2s"/>

    Heavier. Slower. More sensitive.
    <break time="2s"/>

    This is progesterone. This is not weakness. This is biology.
    <break time="3s"/>

    Your body is preparing for rest, for renewal, for deep wisdom.
    <break time="2s"/>

    The world tells you to stay productive, to push through.
    <break time="2s"/>

    But your luteal phase whispers: slow down. Turn inward. Listen.
    <break time="3s"/>

    Imagine a screen about six feet in front of you. This is your mental screen.
    <break time="2s"/>

    On this screen, see yourself tomorrow during your luteal phase.
    <break time="2s"/>

    Watch yourself choosing rest when your body asks for it.
    <break time="2s"/>

    See yourself saying no to demands that drain you.
    <break time="2s"/>

    Notice how natural this feels. This is not laziness. This is self-preservation.
    <break time="3s"/>

    Your luteal phase is a superpower disguised as a slowdown.
    <break time="2s"/>

    This is when you process. When you integrate. When you become wise.
    <break time="3s"/>

    Press your thumb, index finger, and middle finger together gently.
    <break time="2s"/>

    This is your luteal anchor. Whenever you press these three fingers together, you will remember:
    <break time="2s"/>

    Progesterone is intelligence. My body knows what it needs.
    <break time="3s"/>

    Release your fingers. The anchor is set.
    <break time="2s"/>

    Repeat these truths silently as I speak them:
    <break time="2s"/>

    I honor my rhythm.
    <break time="2s"/>

    I am becoming someone who works with my cycle, not against it.
    <break time="2s"/>

    My luteal phase is wisdom, not weakness.
    <break time="2s"/>

    Every day, in every way, I'm learning to trust my body.
    <break time="3s"/>

    In a moment, I will count from one to five, and you will return feeling grounded and aligned.
    <break time="2s"/>

    One... Beginning to return. Energy flowing back gently.
    <break time="2s"/>

    Two... Bringing this luteal wisdom with you.
    <break time="2s"/>

    Three... Your body remembers. You are safe in your rhythm.
    <break time="2s"/>

    Four... Feeling alert, calm, and deeply aligned.
    <break time="2s"/>

    Five... Open your eyes. You are fully present and at peace with your cycle.
    <break time="2s"/>

## Script 2: Sleep Induction (7 min, ~2,500 chars)

**Purpose**: Deep sleep induction with delta wave preparation
**When to use**: Bedtime, especially luteal/menstrual phases
**Frequency**: Delta wave (2 Hz)

```xml
<speak>
  <prosody rate="0.80" pitch="-3st">
    You are safe. Your body knows how to sleep.
    <break time="3s"/>

    Close your eyes if they aren't already closed.
    <break time="2s"/>

    Let's count down into deep rest.
    <break time="2s"/>

    Five... Your body is heavy, sinking into the bed.
    <break time="3s"/>

    Four... Your breath slows. Each exhale is a release.
    <break time="3s"/>

    Three... Your mind begins to drift like a leaf on water.
    <break time="3s"/>

    Two... You are entering the threshold of sleep. This is safe.
    <break time="3s"/>

    One... You are in delta now. Deep rest is coming.
    <break time="4s"/>

    Notice the weight of your head on the pillow.
    <break time="2s"/>

    Your jaw unclenches. Your tongue rests softly in your mouth.
    <break time="3s"/>

    Your shoulders drop away from your ears. Tension melts.
    <break time="3s"/>

    Each breath carries you deeper into stillness.
    <break time="3s"/>

    If you're in your luteal phase, your body is naturally preparing for sleep right now.
    <break time="2s"/>

    Progesterone makes you drowsy. This is not a problem. This is design.
    <break time="3s"/>

    Your body is saying: it's time to rest, to restore, to dream.
    <break time="3s"/>

    There is nothing you need to do right now.
    <break time="2s"/>

    No problem to solve. No task to complete.
    <break time="2s"/>

    This moment is only for rest.
    <break time="4s"/>

    Imagine a warm, gentle wave washing over you from head to toe.
    <break time="2s"/>

    This wave carries away any remaining tension.
    <break time="2s"/>

    Your forehead smooths. Your eyes soften behind your eyelids.
    <break time="3s"/>

    Your chest rises and falls like the ocean. Slow. Steady. Natural.
    <break time="3s"/>

    Your arms are heavy. Your legs are heavy. You are sinking.
    <break time="3s"/>

    Sleep is not something you do. Sleep is something you allow.
    <break time="3s"/>

    And right now, you are allowing.
    <break time="4s"/>

    Your nervous system shifts into its rest-and-digest state.
    <break time="2s"/>

    Your heart rate slows. Your blood pressure lowers.
    <break time="2s"/>

    Delta waves begin to rise in your brain.
    <break time="3s"/>

    This is the frequency of deep, healing sleep.
    <break time="3s"/>

    You are safe. You are held. You are allowed to let go.
    <break time="4s"/>

    If thoughts arise, let them drift by like clouds.
    <break time="2s"/>

    You don't need to follow them. You don't need to solve them.
    <break time="2s"/>

    Just breathe. Just sink. Just allow.
    <break time="4s"/>

    Sleep will find you. It always does.
    <break time="3s"/>

    Your only job now is to surrender.
    <break time="4s"/>

    Let go.
    <break time="5s"/>

    Let go.
    <break time="5s"/>

    Sleep is here.
    <break time="10s"/>
  </prosody>

## Script 3: Habit Installation (7 min, ~2,500 chars)

**Purpose**: Install new habit using Mental Screen technique
**When to use**: Evening before sleep, follicular phase ideal
**Frequency**: Theta wave (6 Hz)
**Variables**: `[HABIT_CUE]`, `[HABIT_BEHAVIOR]`, `[HABIT_REWARD]`

```xml
<speak>
  <prosody rate="0.85" pitch="-2st">
    Close your eyes. Take a deep breath.
    <break time="2s"/>

    We're going to install a new habit tonight. Not through willpower. Through visualization.
    <break time="2s"/>

    Your subconscious mind doesn't know the difference between a vivid visualization and reality.
    <break time="2s"/>

    What you see clearly on your mental screen can become your new normal.
    <break time="3s"/>

    Let's count down into alpha.
    <break time="2s"/>

    Five... Relaxing deeply.
    <break time="3s"/>

    Four... Breath slowing naturally.
    <break time="3s"/>

    Three... Thoughts quieting.
    <break time="3s"/>

    Two... Entering your inner sanctuary.
    <break time="3s"/>

    One... You are now in alpha. Receptive. Open. Ready.
    <break time="3s"/>

    Imagine a screen about six feet in front of you. Like a movie screen.
    <break time="2s"/>

    On this screen, you're going to watch yourself tomorrow.
    <break time="2s"/>

    See yourself when [HABIT_CUE] happens.
    <break time="2s"/>

    Maybe it's finishing lunch. Maybe it's waking up. Maybe it's coming home.
    <break time="2s"/>

    Watch yourself in this moment. See it clearly.
    <break time="3s"/>

    Now, watch yourself naturally, easily [HABIT_BEHAVIOR].
    <break time="2s"/>

    Notice how automatic it feels. Like you've been doing this for years.
    <break time="2s"/>

    There's no resistance. No willpower needed. It's just what you do now.
    <break time="3s"/>

    See the details. What are you wearing? Where are you?
    <break time="2s"/>

    Notice how your body moves. See yourself doing this with ease.
    <break time="3s"/>

    Now, watch yourself feel [HABIT_REWARD].
    <break time="2s"/>

    Maybe it's a sense of calm. Maybe it's energy. Maybe it's pride.
    <break time="2s"/>

    Let yourself feel this reward fully. This is why you do this habit.
    <break time="3s"/>

    Your subconscious mind is learning right now:
    <break time="2s"/>

    When [HABIT_CUE] happens, I [HABIT_BEHAVIOR], and I feel [HABIT_REWARD].
    <break time="3s"/>

    This is your new identity. This is who you are becoming.
    <break time="3s"/>

    If you're in your follicular phase, your brain is especially plastic right now.
    <break time="2s"/>

    Estrogen helps you learn new patterns. Your neurons are forming new connections.
    <break time="2s"/>

    This is the perfect time to install a habit.
    <break time="3s"/>

    Press your thumb, index finger, and middle finger together.
    <break time="2s"/>

    This is your habit anchor. Tomorrow, when [HABIT_CUE] happens, press these three fingers.
    <break time="2s"/>

    Your body will remember this moment. It will remember what to do.
    <break time="3s"/>

    Release your fingers.
    <break time="2s"/>

    Repeat these truths silently:
    <break time="2s"/>

    I am becoming someone who [HABIT_BEHAVIOR].
    <break time="2s"/>

    This habit is easy and natural for me.
    <break time="2s"/>

    Every day, in every way, I'm aligning with my highest self.
    <break time="3s"/>

    In a moment, you'll return, and this new pattern will be installed.
    <break time="2s"/>

    One... Beginning to return.
    <break time="2s"/>

    Two... Bringing this new habit with you.
    <break time="2s"/>

    Three... Your subconscious remembers.
    <break time="2s"/>

    Four... Feeling confident and aligned.
    <break time="2s"/>

    Five... Open your eyes. The habit is installed. Tomorrow, you'll see.
    <break time="2s"/>

## Script 4: Anxiety Reset (3 min, ~1,500 chars)

**Purpose**: Quick nervous system regulation for acute anxiety
**When to use**: Anxiety spikes, PMS irritability, panic moments
**Frequency**: Alpha wave (10 Hz) → Theta (6 Hz)

```xml
<speak>
  <prosody rate="0.90" pitch="-1st">
    This feeling is temporary. You are safe right now.
    <break time="2s"/>

    Close your eyes. Place one hand on your heart.
    <break time="2s"/>

    Breathe in for five counts. One, two, three, four, five.
    <break time="1s"/>

    Hold for five. One, two, three, four, five.
    <break time="1s"/>

    Exhale for five. One, two, three, four, five.
    <break time="2s"/>

    Again. Inhale. One, two, three, four, five.
    <break time="1s"/>

    Hold. One, two, three, four, five.
    <break time="1s"/>

    Exhale. One, two, three, four, five.
    <break time="3s"/>

    Your nervous system is shifting right now. From sympathetic to parasympathetic.
    <break time="2s"/>

    From fight-or-flight to rest-and-digest.
    <break time="2s"/>

    This is not dangerous. This is your body's wisdom.
    <break time="3s"/>

    If you're in your luteal phase, anxiety spikes are common.
    <break time="2s"/>

    Progesterone affects your GABA receptors. This is biochemistry, not your fault.
    <break time="2s"/>

    You are not broken. You are cycling.
    <break time="3s"/>

    Press your thumb, index finger, and middle finger together.
    <break time="2s"/>

    This is your calm anchor. Feel it working. Your body remembers safety.
    <break time="3s"/>

    Imagine two mirrors in front of you.
    <break time="2s"/>

    On the left, see yourself anxious, overwhelmed.
    <break time="2s"/>

    Acknowledge this. It's real. It's okay.
    <break time="2s"/>

    Now look to the right mirror.
    <break time="2s"/>

    See yourself calm. Grounded. Breathing steadily.
    <break time="2s"/>

    This version of you knows: this storm will pass.
    <break time="2s"/>

    Step into the right mirror. Feel this as your reality now.
    <break time="3s"/>

    You are safe. You are capable. You can handle this.
    <break time="3s"/>

    This anxiety is a wave. You are the ocean.
    <break time="2s"/>

    Waves rise. Waves fall. The ocean remains.
    <break time="3s"/>

    One more breath. In for five. One, two, three, four, five.
    <break time="1s"/>

    Hold. One, two, three, four, five.
    <break time="1s"/>

    Out for five. One, two, three, four, five.
    <break time="3s"/>

    When you open your eyes, the intensity will have softened.
    <break time="2s"/>

    One, two, three. Eyes open. You've got this.
    <break time="2s"/>
  </prosody>
</speak>

## Script 5: Body Acceptance (7 min, ~2,500 chars)

**Purpose**: Release cycle shame and body criticism
**When to use**: Menstrual phase (self-compassion window)
**Frequency**: Theta wave (6 Hz)

```xml
<speak>
  <prosody rate="0.85" pitch="-2st">
    Close your eyes. Take a deep breath.
    <break time="2s"/>

    Your body is not the enemy. Your cycle is not a curse.
    <break time="2s"/>

    Today, we release the shame you've carried about being hormonal.
    <break time="3s"/>

    Let's count down together.
    <break time="2s"/>

    Five... Your body relaxes. You are safe here.
    <break time="3s"/>

    Four... Your breath finds its rhythm.
    <break time="3s"/>

    Three... Thoughts quiet. Judgment fades.
    <break time="3s"/>

    Two... You enter your sanctuary of self-compassion.
    <break time="3s"/>

    One... You are in alpha. Your heart is open.
    <break time="3s"/>

    Imagine a warm, golden light above your head.
    <break time="2s"/>

    This is the light of acceptance. Of unconditional love.
    <break time="2s"/>

    Let this light pour down over you like honey.
    <break time="3s"/>

    It flows over your forehead. Your face. Your neck.
    <break time="2s"/>

    It fills your chest. Your belly. Your pelvis.
    <break time="2s"/>

    Every part of you that's been criticized is now held in golden light.
    <break time="3s"/>

    Your body has been doing impossible work your entire cycle.
    <break time="2s"/>

    Building. Shedding. Healing. Renewing.
    <break time="2s"/>

    Every month, your body performs miracles, and you've been calling it dysfunction.
    <break time="3s"/>

    Imagine a screen in front of you.
    <break time="2s"/>

    On this screen, see your younger self, maybe age twelve or thirteen.
    <break time="2s"/>

    The first time someone called you moody. Hormonal. Too much.
    <break time="2s"/>

    See how that younger you internalized that shame.
    <break time="3s"/>

    Now, as your present self, step into the screen.
    <break time="2s"/>

    Put your hand on her shoulder. Look her in the eyes.
    <break time="2s"/>

    Tell her: There is nothing wrong with you.
    <break time="2s"/>

    Tell her: Your cycle is intelligence, not dysfunction.
    <break time="2s"/>

    Tell her: You are allowed to change. You are allowed to feel.
    <break time="3s"/>

    Watch her face soften. Watch the shame begin to lift.
    <break time="3s"/>

    Now create a second mirror on your right.
    <break time="2s"/>

    In this mirror, see yourself tomorrow, living in full acceptance of your cycle.
    <break time="2s"/>

    You rest during your menstrual phase without guilt.
    <break time="2s"/>

    You honor your luteal need to slow down.
    <break time="2s"/>

    You celebrate your follicular energy when it rises.
    <break time="2s"/>

    You trust your ovulation intuition.
    <break time="3s"/>

    This is not indulgence. This is self-preservation.
    <break time="2s"/>

    This is not weakness. This is wisdom.
    <break time="3s"/>

    Press your three fingers together.
    <break time="2s"/>

    This is your body acceptance anchor.
    <break time="2s"/>

    Whenever shame arises about your cycle, press these fingers and remember:
    <break time="2s"/>

    My body is not broken. My cycle is brilliant.
    <break time="3s"/>

    Release your fingers.
    <break time="2s"/>

    Repeat these truths:
    <break time="2s"/>

    I release the belief that my hormones make me less than.
    <break time="2s"/>

    I am becoming someone who honors all phases of my cycle.
    <break time="2s"/>

    My body's rhythm is intelligence, not inconvenience.
    <break time="2s"/>

    Every day, I am learning to trust what my body knows.
    <break time="3s"/>

    The golden light continues to glow around you.
    <break time="2s"/>

    This light will stay with you as you return.
    <break time="2s"/>

    One... Beginning to come back.
    <break time="2s"/>

    Two... Bringing this acceptance with you.
    <break time="2s"/>

    Three... Your body is safe. You are whole.
    <break time="2s"/>

    Four... Feeling compassion for yourself and your cycle.
    <break time="2s"/>

    Five... Open your eyes. You are free.
    <break time="2s"/>
  </prosody>
</speak>

```javascript
{
  voice_id: "21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM",  // Rachel
  model_id: "eleven_multilingual_v2",
  voice_settings: {
    stability: 0.75,
    similarity_boost: 0.8,
    style: 0.3
  }
}
```

### Script-Specific Speed Adjustments:

| Script | Speaking Rate | Pitch | Why |
|--------|---------------|-------|-----|

## Customization Variables (Habit Installation Only)

When user selects "Habit Installation" template, they fill in 3 blanks:

**Example 1: Walking habit**
- `[HABIT_CUE]`: "finishing lunch"
- `[HABIT_BEHAVIOR]`: "put on my walking shoes and go outside for 10 minutes"
- `[HABIT_REWARD]`: "calm and energized"

**Example 2: Morning meditation**

---

## Safety Compliance

All scripts follow **SAFETY_PROTOCOLS.md** guidelines:

✅ **Template-first** (no free-form recording)
✅ **Positive framing** ("I am becoming..." not "I am not...")
✅ **Cycle-aware** (acknowledges biology, not dysfunction)
✅ **No medical claims** (uses "may feel" not "will cure")
✅ **Empowering language** (user choice, not obligation)
✅ **Three-finger anchor** (Silva Method technique)
✅ **Return countdown** (safe return from trance)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Choose TTS provider** (Google Cloud Neural2 recommended for MVP)
2. **Generate all 5 scripts** as MP3 files
3. **Test with users** (does the voice feel calming?)
4. **Create TTS generation script** (Node.js automation)
5. **Integrate into 02-hypnosis-screen.html** (replace placeholder audio)

Want me to create the Node.js TTS generation script next?
