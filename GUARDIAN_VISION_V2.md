# Guardian Vision V2: Beyond Finch
## "What if we actually understood behavior change?"

## Core Innovation: 3 Pillars Finch Doesn't Have

### 1. Self-Hypnosis Integration (Deep Mental Health Tool)
**Problem with Finch:** Surface-level ("do breathing exercise")
**Guardian Solution:** Guided self-hypnosis sessions narrated by your Guardian

#### Features:
- **Progressive Muscle Relaxation** (PMR) - 5-10 min sessions
- **Visualization Scripts** - Tailored to cycle phase
  - Follicular: Energy-building imagery
  - Ovulation: Confidence affirmations
  - Luteal: Grounding, acceptance
  - Menstrual: Rest, release
- **Habit Installation Hypnosis** - Subconscious reprogramming for habits
- **Anxiety Interrupts** - 90-second reset sessions

**Delivery:**
- Guardian's voice (text-to-speech with calming tone)
- Binaural beats option (alpha/theta waves)
- Cycle-synchronized scripts
- No "skip" button during session (commitment device)

**Differentiation:**
- Finch: "Do a breathing exercise" ✅ Generic
- Guardian: "Your luteal phase needs grounding. Let's do a 7-minute body scan." ✅ Personalized to biology

### 2. Atomic Habits Framework (Real Behavior Change)
**Problem with Finch:** No system, just gamified tasks
**Guardian Solution:** James Clear's 4 Laws applied to cycle-aware habits

#### The 4 Laws (Atomic Habits):
1. **Make it Obvious** (Cue)
2. **Make it Attractive** (Craving)
3. **Make it Easy** (Response)
4. **Make it Satisfying** (Reward)

#### How Guardian Implements It:

**LAW 1: Make it Obvious**
- **Implementation Intention**: "When [TRIGGER], I will [BEHAVIOR]"
  - Example: "When I pour my morning coffee, I will drink a glass of water"
- **Habit Stacking**: Link new habits to existing ones
  - Example: "After I brush my teeth, I will do 5 minutes of stretching"
- **Environment Design**: Guardian suggests cue placement
  - "Put your water bottle next to your coffee maker"

**LAW 2: Make it Attractive**
- **Temptation Bundling**: Pair needed habit with wanted activity
  - "Only listen to your favorite podcast while walking"
- **Cycle-Based Motivation**: Guardian explains WHY this habit matters NOW
  - "Your follicular phase has high energy—this is the perfect time to build momentum"

**LAW 3: Make it Easy**
- **Two-Minute Rule**: Every habit starts with a 2-minute version
  - Don't plan "work out for 30 minutes"
  - Do: "Put on workout clothes" (2 min)
- **Reduce Friction**: Guardian suggests preparation
  - "Tonight: Lay out your workout clothes"
  - "Tonight: Pre-portion tomorrow's snacks"

**LAW 4: Make it Satisfying**
- **Immediate Reward**: Thread progresses (visual knitting)
- **Habit Tracker**: Don't break the chain visualization
- **Identity Reinforcement**: Guardian reflects your identity shift
  - "You're becoming someone who prioritizes rest during your luteal phase"

#### Guardian's Habit Architecture

**Not:** Random task list
**Instead:** Structured habit formation system

```
User selects: "I want to exercise more"

Guardian breaks it down:
1. Identity: "I'm becoming an active person" (not "I need to work out")
2. Tiny Habit: "Put on workout shoes" (not "go to gym for 1 hour")
3. Cue Design: "After morning coffee" (specific trigger)
4. Friction Removal: "Lay out shoes the night before"
5. Cycle Adaptation:
   - Follicular (Days 1-7): High-intensity possible
   - Ovulation (Days 8-14): Peak energy, try new things
   - Luteal (Days 15-21): Lower intensity, gentle movement
   - Menstrual (Days 22-28): Rest is the habit
```

**The Knitting Metaphor Maps to Habit Building:**
- Each stitch = One day of consistency
- Each row = One week (7 stitches)
- Each mitten = One full habit cycle (28 days)
- Ovulation trigger (Day 14) = Halfway checkpoint, major momentum boost

---

### 3. Cycle-Synchronized Habit Recommendations
**Problem with Finch:** Same habits every day (ignores biology)
**Guardian Solution:** Different habits for different phases

#### The Science:
- **Follicular Phase (Days 1-13):** High estrogen → High energy, creativity, social
- **Ovulation (Day 14):** Peak testosterone → Confidence, risk-taking, communication
- **Luteal Phase (Days 15-28):** Rising progesterone → Introspection, detail work, nesting
- **Menstrual (Days 1-5):** Low hormones → Rest, reflection, release

#### Guardian's Adaptive Habit Suggestions:

**Follicular Phase Habits:**
- Try new workouts (energy is high)
- Social activities (estrogen boosts connection)
- Creative projects (cognitive flexibility peaks)
- Learning new skills (neuroplasticity enhanced)

**Ovulation Phase Habits:**
- Important conversations (communication peaks)
- Challenging workouts (strength peaks)
- Public speaking/presentations (confidence high)
- Networking (social energy maxed)

**Luteal Phase Habits:**
- Detailed work (focus narrows)
- Home organization (nesting instinct)
- Meal prep (planning for upcoming menstrual phase)
- Journaling (introspection increases)

**Menstrual Phase Habits:**
- Rest as the habit (not "pushing through")
- Gentle movement only (yin yoga, walking)
- Releasing what's not working (reflection)
- Low-demand activities (read, watch, nap)

**Guardian's Prompt:**
> "You're in your luteal phase. High-intensity goals will feel harder right now. What if we focused on organizing your space instead? That aligns with your body's natural rhythm."

**vs Finch:**
> "Complete 3 tasks today!" (no awareness of biology)

## The Full Guardian Experience

### Morning Flow (5 minutes)

**1. Cycle Check-In (30 seconds)**
- "Today is Day 18 of your cycle (Luteal Phase)"
- Thread visualization shows progress

**2. Atmosphere Reading (30 seconds)**
- ☀️ Sunny / ☁️ Cloudy / ⛈️ Storm
- Guardian responds: "I see the storm. I'm here with you."

**3. Habit Selection (2 minutes)**
Guardian suggests 2-3 habits based on:
- Your cycle phase
- Yesterday's atmosphere
- Long-term identity goal
- Current habit stack

Example:
> "Since you're in your luteal phase and yesterday was stormy, what if today's only goal is: *Take a 10-minute walk after lunch*?"
>
> **Why this habit:**
> - Cue: "After lunch" (existing routine)
> - Easy: 10 minutes (2-minute rule extended)
> - Aligned: Luteal phase = gentle movement
> - Satisfying: Thread progresses

**4. Self-Hypnosis Option (2 minutes)**
> "Would you like a 7-minute grounding session? Your luteal phase responds well to body awareness."

### Evening Reflection (3 minutes)

**1. Habit Check (1 minute)**
- Did you do your habit?
- ✅ Yes → Thread stitches (knitting progresses)
- ❌ No → Guardian: "What got in the way? Let's adjust the cue for tomorrow."

**2. Offering Log (30 seconds)**
- Simple / Nourishing / Stimulating (food today)

**3. Tomorrow's Prep (1 minute)**
- Guardian: "To make tomorrow's habit easier, lay out your walking shoes tonight."
- (Implementation of "reduce friction" law)

**4. Optional Hypnosis (1 minute)**
- "Would you like a 5-minute sleep script?"

## Technical Implementation

### Data Structure

```javascript
const user = {
  // Cycle tracking
  cycleDay: 18,
  cycleLength: 28,
  phase: 'luteal', // follicular, ovulation, luteal, menstrual

  // Identity-based habits (Atomic Habits)
  identity: "I'm becoming someone who moves daily",
  targetHabit: {
    behavior: "10-minute walk",
    cue: "after lunch",
    frequency: "daily",
    tinyVersion: "Put on walking shoes",
    frictionReduction: "Shoes by door night before"
  },

  // Habit tracking
  habitStreak: 12,
  threadProgress: {
    stitches: 12, // days
    rows: 1,      // weeks
    mittens: 0    // full cycles
  },

  // Daily state
  atmosphere: 'storm', // sunny, cloudy, storm
  offering: 'nourishing', // simple, nourishing, stimulating

  // Hypnosis preferences
  preferredVoice: 'calm-female',
  binauralBeats: true,
  sessionLength: '7min'
}
```

### Guardian State Logic (User-Responsive + Cycle-Aware)

```javascript
function updateGuardianState(user) {
  const { atmosphere, offering, cycleDay, phase } = user;

  // Storm atmosphere → Guardian moves close
  if (atmosphere === 'storm') {
    return {
      position: 'close',
      message: offering === 'stimulating'
        ? "I see you're in the storm. I'm here, steady and quiet."
        : "Storms pass. I'm staying close.",
      hypnosisOffer: "Would you like a 5-minute anxiety reset?"
    };
  }

  // Ovulation (Day 14) → Special alert
  if (cycleDay === 14) {
    return {
      position: 'alert',
      animation: 'ovulation-sparkle',
      message: "This is your power day. The thread leaps forward.",
      habitSuggestion: "Try something bold today—your energy is peak."
    };
  }

  // Menstrual phase → Guardian distant (permission to rest)
  if (phase === 'menstrual') {
    return {
      position: 'distant-resting',
      message: "Rest is the work right now. I've stepped back.",
      habitSuggestion: "Today's habit: Do one gentle thing for yourself."
    };
  }

  // Default: Nearby observing
  return {
    position: 'nearby',
    message: "I'm here, observing your rhythm.",
    habitSuggestion: getPhaseAlignedHabit(phase)
  };
}
```

## Success Metrics (What "Better" Means)

**Finch measures:**
- Daily active users
- Task completion rate

**Guardian measures:**
- **Habit adherence rate** (not task completion, but long-term behavior change)
- **Cycle-phase alignment** (are users working WITH their biology?)
- **Identity shift** (do users self-report as "someone who [habit]"?)
- **Atmospheric awareness** (can users name their state without numeric scale?)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Read Atomic Habits** (if you haven't) - Need to nail the 4 Laws
2. **Research self-hypnosis scripts** - PMR, visualization templates
3. **Design habit builder UI** - Make the 4 Laws visually clear
4. **Build cycle calendar** - Visual mapping of phases
5. **Prototype thread visualization** - Test knitting metaphor

Want me to start building the Guardian V2 prototype with these features?
