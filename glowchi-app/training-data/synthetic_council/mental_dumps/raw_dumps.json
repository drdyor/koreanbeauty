I can't breathe when I think about it too hard. I'm an atheist so I don't have the comfort of an afterlife. I know this is irrational because I won't experience being dead, but the anticipation is unbearable. I've tried therapy and medication and meditation and nothing helps. It comes in waves - sometimes I'm fine for months and then it hits me and I'm paralyzed for days. I feel like I'm broken. Other people seem to handle this. Why can't I?
